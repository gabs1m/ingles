            <p>Dear diary,</p>
            <div id="indent">
                <p>today was a calm day. I woke up early as always and took the bus to go to school. There wasn't too many people, so I chose a good place to sit, close to my friend. Unfortunately, this doesn't always happen. Once, I had to sit close to two girls who are loud talkers, and the worst thing was that I had an exam on this day. I couldn't rest and got to school with a headache.</p>
                <p>On the way, we shared our snacks - cookies, cakes and juices, and listened to some music. We got to school listening to Harry Styles and Shawn Mendes. Before going to class, we went to the dining hall to store my lunch on the refrigerator and I found a lot of my colleagues. We talked a lot!!! I enjoyed that time before classes, because I don't take the same classes as them, because of our age difference. Which isn't actually a problem. We have a lot in common. We even make projects together! By the way, I take part in one about astronomy, where a group of students and I hang out at night to observe the stars and study them. I adore astronomy and it is the area I intend on working in the future!</p>
                <p>I said bye to my friends and headed to the classroom. There I found out the teacher wasn't coming and the class was cancelled. Which was amazing to me! I'm full of work to do and I have to advance it as much as I can. The literature teacher asked for a Shakespeare's book "A Midsummer Night's Dream" analysis and I didn't even finish reading! While I was reading, one of my friends was doing my hair. I wanted to look beautiful for later. I would have to stay at school to deal with some things regarding my astronomy project and I knew that Samuel, the boy I have a major crush on, would stay too for his I.T. internship.</p>
                <p>As every teenager, I've always questioned myself about my sexuality. I went to another elementary school and there I felt some things that made me realize that I was bisexual. However, that wasn't a comfortable experience. I met a very nice girl in eighth grade. I remember it like it was yesterday: I was at the library trying to turn the computer on, but I couldn't do it. I started panicking, because I had to turn in homework I hadn't done until that day, when a blonde girl with pink highlights and the most beautiful brown eyes I've ever seen offered to help! She was using another computer close to me and I didn't even notice. After that, we talked and I noticed that she was really nice and we had a lot in common.</p>
                <p>We became friends and always met at the library to study together. Soon I noticed a feeling that grew inside me whenever I saw her. At first I was very confused and didn't want to accept it, but it was love. However, no relationship was possible between us, mainly because I didn't have the courage to declare myself. And when I decided to do so, I saw her talking intimately with a boy from my class. They dated. And she didn't say anything to me. When I asked her why she hadn't told me, she replied that she knew I liked her. And that she didn't mind having a black girl as a friend, but as a girlfriend it was something else.</p>
                <p>I don't remember what I did right after that. All I know is that I got home and cried the rest of the day. Soon enough, I graduated and started going to another school, and now I try to face this event as a good thing: the episode that made me realize my true sexuality, because I had only fallen in love with boys before. Like now, with Samuel.</p>
                <p>I finished my work and went to take a look in the bathroom mirror. I was prettier, my friend totally crushed it! I went back to the classroom and had my other classes. Then I went to have lunch. The cafeteria was empty. When I was done, I sat on a corner to read. My book of the month is “Dork Diaries” by Rachel Renée Russell. I don't know why, but I really relate to this book! I was reading and writing down the main parts in my reading notebook, when I heard someone asking me what I was reading. I looked up and saw a tall, dark-haired boy dressed in a Star Wars T-shirt that I would recognize from afar. It was Samuel!</p>
                <p>We started talking and soon we were talking about our projects and things of the sort. It's already 6 P.M. when we had to say goodbye. He offered me a ride home and I took it! On the way we returned in silence. We only got back to talking in front of my house. I was opening the car door when Samuel held my arm lightly and asked if I wanted to go out with him sometime. I said yes and went home. I'm still celebrating what happened!</p>
